# Sphinx-Rust

An effort to get rust documentation in Sphinx.

Based on the following projects:
+ https://github.com/bastikr/sphinx-julia/
+ https://github.com/bronto/javasphinx

Starting with a rust domain. Hoping to get the domain
linked automatically to the regular rust api documentation.

**Extremely WIP**
